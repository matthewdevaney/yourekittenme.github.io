Where are they coming from?  What content are they engaging with and why?  These are all questions you need a web analytics service to answer.  &lt;a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/"&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt; is the most widely used web analytics on the internet.

You can implement comments on your website but the trick is to use a service that will host it for you.  &lt;a href="https://disqus.com/"&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt; is a popular solution to this problem.

The answer is simple: yourdomain.com.  If you are hosting your website on a free service such as &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt; you'll be assigned the former, not the latter.
